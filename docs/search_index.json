In each week, you will find the code, exercises, and slides for corresponding topic. Before you start, check the required software and packages below. Also, don’t forget to read the Syllabus and the Perusall with the readings for the course. This site will be corrected/updated throughout the semester. 0.1 Software and Packages For the first part of this course (Weeks 1 - 5), we will be mainly using R. For the second part of the this course (Weeks 6 - 11), we will use a combination of R and Python. I will assume that you are familiar with R language, RStudio, and R packages. If you are not, please come to office hours and I can help you out1. In R the main packages, we you will need to have the following packages installed: tidyverse (we will be piping) tidylog (helps keep track of what your are pipins) tidytext (great for working with text) quanteda (stands for “Quantitative Analysis of Textual Data”) 0.2 Datasets Throughout the class, we will be using a number of sample datasets. Access to these datasets will be provided directly on the code. For your Final Essay, you can use one of the following datasets (or, even better, you can use your own): data 1 + link data 2 + link data 3 + link 0.3 Acknowledgments The organization of the first part of this course (Weeks 1 - 5) and the format of the assignments are borrowed from Christopher Barrie’s excellent course on “Computational Text Analysis”, a syllabus from the prolific Tiago Ventura, and Grimmer, Roberts, and Stewart’s excellent book, “Text as data: A new framework for machine learning and the social sciences”. The code used throughout the course is a patchwork of my own code, but my own code borrows heavily from the internet (but that’s true for all code). I try my best to give credit to the original authors of the code (when and if possible). It might even be faster to get one of your classmates or colleagues to help you out.↩︎ "]]
